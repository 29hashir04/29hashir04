ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — based on your résumé
Hashir Ul Wara

, here’s a tailored version of those GitHub-style profile prompts filled in for you:

🔭 I’m currently working on my final year project “Live Walking Pattern Analysis Using Pose Estimation” using Python, Mediapipe, OpenCV, and Firebase.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML projects, data-driven applications, and real-time video processing systems.

🤝 I’m looking for help with exploring career opportunities in data engineering, AI, and entry-level cybersecurity to gain hands-on industry exposure.

🌱 I’m currently learning data engineering concepts, ETL pipelines, cloud-based tools, and strengthening my skills in data structures and algorithms.

💬 Ask me about Python, SQL, real-time data processing, data analytics, and project coordination for freelance teams.

⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on long walks, playing football, or enjoying a good board game session.

Do you want me to make this GitHub-ready with emoji formatting (like a polished “About Me” section) so you can paste it directly into your GitHub README/profile?


Sources
You said:
I have a readme about me ready, where I can paste that code in github?
ChatGPT said:
Great 👌 here’s how you can put that About Me section into your GitHub profile README:

📌 Steps
Create a special repository

Go to GitHub and click the + (top-right) → New repository.

Name the repository exactly the same as your GitHub username (for example, if your username is hashirulwara, the repo name must be hashirulwara).

GitHub will recognize it as your profile repository.

Initialize with a README

On the repo creation page, check the box “Add a README file”.

This README will show up on your GitHub profile page.

Edit the README

Open your new repository → click README.md.

Click the pencil ✏️ icon to edit.

Paste the About Me block (with emojis and all).

Commit changes

Scroll down, add a commit message like “Added About Me section”, then click Commit changes.

Check your profile

Go to github.com/YourUsername.

You’ll now see your About Me section displayed at the top of your profile.

⚡ Pro tip: You can use Markdown for styling — headings (##), bold (**bold**), italics, lists, even images/GIFs.

👉 Do you want me to format your About Me section with proper Markdown & emojis so you can paste it directly and it looks visually clean on GitHub?

You said:
should I have to keep the repo public?
ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ — you must keep the repo public if you want your GitHub profile README to show up on your public profile.

If the repo is private, only you will see it, and the “About Me” section won’t appear on your profile page.

GitHub requires the username/username repo to be public for the profile README feature to work.

So in short:
👉 Repo name = your GitHub username
👉 Repo visibility = Public
👉 README.md = your About Me section

Do you want me to also show you how to add extra styling (like collapsible sections, shields.io badges, or skill icons) to make your README stand out more?

this is the code
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing your README code 👌
The error you’re seeing —

Something went wrong! file an issue at https://tiny.one/readme-stats
API rate limit already exceeded for user ID XXXXX
— comes from GitHub Readme Stats (and similar widgets like streak stats, contributor stats). These services fetch data from GitHub’s API, and when too many requests are made, they hit the rate limit.

🔧 How to Fix It
You have two main options:

Option 1: Use a Personal Access Token (Recommended)
Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic).

Click Generate new token (classic) → select minimal scopes: just read:user.

Copy the token (keep it safe).

In your profile README repo, create a new GitHub Secret:

Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.

Name it: PAT_1

Value: your token

Update your README stats links to use your token, e.g.:

![](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=29hashir04&show_icons=true&theme=radical&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true&token=${{ secrets.PAT_1 }})
This way, the widget uses your own API quota instead of the shared free one (which often hits limits).

Option 2: Use Alternative Services
For streak stats: use streak-stats.demolab.com instead of nirzak-streak-stats.

For trophies: you can keep github-profile-trophy — it’s usually fine.

For visitor count: those services can sometimes break, so it’s optional.

Example fixed streak stats line:

![](https://streak-stats.demolab.com?user=29hashir04&theme=radical&hide_border=false)
⚡ Quick Fix for You:
If you don’t want to set up tokens right now, you can just swap your streak stats line with this:

![](https://streak-stats.demolab.com?user=29hashir04&theme=radical&hide_border=false)
That should remove the “Something went wrong” issue immediately.

👉 Do you want me to clean up your full README code with fixes (better streak stats, working badges, and removing duplicates like Firebase appearing twice), so you can paste a polished version directly?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 I’ll clean up your README code:

✅ Fixed streak stats (using streak-stats.demolab.com instead of broken nirzak).

✅ Removed duplicate Firebase badge.

✅ Cleaned LinkedIn badge link (yours had linkedin.com/in/https://...).

✅ Kept your badges, trophies, and visit counter.

✅ Markdown formatting cleaned.

Here’s the polished version 👇 — you can paste this directly into your README.md:
